\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a new consensus algorithm based on Byzantine Fault Tolerant\cite{ARTICLE:1} RAFT \cite{ARTICLE:2} with a hybrid architecture framework that proposes linear as well as exponential robustness in the back-end systems supporting various sorts of transactions that demand absolute speed, resilience, accuracy, integrity and trust.

\section{Background}
Distributed systems have become quintessential in empowering the digital growth of organizations in many verticals. It is a shared responsibility among ourselves to simplify and yet provide architecture that can exhibit stable properties and support financial or commodity transactions from multiple verticals that demand a trusted environment. Readers are highly encouraged to go through the cited articles on PBFT \cite{ARTICLE:1}, RAFT \cite{ARTICLE:2}, and Tangaroa \cite{ARTICLE:3} thoroughly before reviewing this paper.

\section{Introduction}
The TARA architecture leverages a compound set of theories such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\cite{ARTICLE:1}, Raft Algorithm\cite{ARTICLE:2}, and cryptographic message exchange etc. on top of the distributed systems\cite{ARTICLE:3}. Each concept derived from the above is effectively combined to form an architecture that serves the core purpose of laying out a stable architecture to transact, manage and represent relevant transactions of a commodity.
\subsection{Grand Nodes}
Grand nodes are independent group of nodes distributed across the geography to perform as gatekeepers.
Gatekeeping activities include the reception of incoming messages, transaction payloads, and classify them based on the relevant asset class tagged.
Grand nodes are dedicated resources that have above the par computational power to perform gatekeeping activities in a reliable manner. Nodes with a dedicated amount of computational hardware, NTQ and stake can participate as a candidate to be elected as one of the grand node.
\subsection{Star Nodes}
Star nodes are the federated leaders of a small cluster with size ranging from a minimum of 4 nodes and above.
The duty of a Star Nodes is to recieve the set of transactions grouped by grand nodes into respective asset class and perform formal verification of these transactions.
The formally verified transactions are now bundled into a new block based on the timestamp proximity and propogated across other clusters in the network. 
\subsection{Service Nodes}
Service Nodes are the followers in the cluster, and recieve the asset-specific transactions of interest from their leader Star Node and perform formal verification. Majority of the service nodes are expected to pass the formal verification by default to propogate a block. However, platforms can be given the freedom and flexibility to customize the same intenrally on a case-by-case basis.

\section{Correctness}
We have proposed the TARA architecture, with various design-centric and mathematical techniques that prove the liveness, safety and certainty of the distributed system. The proposed architecture not only prescribes to the theories of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Raft algorithm etc., but also improves upon the robustness of the system over failure rates, thereby making the system free of fault-prone environments and increasing availability without added cost of time and compute.
We are grateful to the authors of cited papers \cite{ARTICLE:1}, \cite{ARTICLE:2} and \cite{ARTICLE:3} for providing invaluable knowledge, research resources, time, guidance and feedback on the TARA architecture.

\section{Applicability}
\subsection{Sentinel Scalability}
\subsection{Modulated Trust}
\subsection{Throughput}

\section{Implementation and evaluation}
\subsection{Reference implementation}
The implementation of the proposed architecture doesnâ€™t require special care or teaching, but needs the practical approach to implementing its technique showcased to drastically reduce the rate of absolute system failure. 

We encourage the reader to contact the author, if any correspondence is required to assist/guide in implementing or evaluating the architecture on an existing BFT Raft system fulfilling the design requirements mentioned in Section 3.1.

Since Raft systems communicate through RPCs, we propose the reader to create a new RPC for nodes to communicate the point of failure and current state to the star node in case of TARA((1,-2), (1,-2)). The AppendEntries RPC[2] from leader may be extended to adding the identity of star nodes.

\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed TARA, with various design-centric attributes and mathematical techniques that prove the liveness, safety and certainty of the distributed system. The proposed architecture not only prescribes to the theories of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Raft algorithm etc., but also improves upon the robustness of the system over failure rates, thereby making the system free of fault-prone environments and increasing availability without added cost of time and compute.
